# 🖧 Cisco Catalyst Switch Lab - 2950-3550

This repository contains my **hands-on lab using a Cisco Catalyst 2950 and 3550 switch**, demonstrating foundational switch management and configuration skills.  

The Cisco Catalyst 2950 is an older managed switch, but it remains a great tool for practicing networking fundamentals.

## 📖 Overview

This lab walks through the full process of connecting to, resetting, configuring, and managing a **Cisco Catalyst 2950 switch** using the CLI.  

It covers console connectivity, factory resets, switch setup from scratch, VLAN management, port security, and monitoring via SPAN.
